A dumb automatic codebreaking tool.

## Why?

I was too lazy to break all the chapter subtitle codes by hand in "Ghost in the Wires".

## To-Do

### to break all the codes in the book

1. implement vigenere cypher (preset words + bruteforce?)
2. find solution for weird 2B 2T W... text
2. find solution for weird 100-11... text, probably morse code?

### further improvements

4. restructure program flow to a better model
5. automatical cypher finder (less bruteforce) - test parts of the inputs first

    * questions usually begin with certain words, use this
    * apostrophes can only be followed by certain letter combinations, use this
    * there aren't that many 1-3 letter words, use this
    * frequency analysis

6. implement the tap code cypher
7. implement the nihilist cypher
8. implement the hill cypher
9. implement the playfair cypher
10. implement old military cyphers (enigma, M138, M209, Purple...)
11. implement the Solitaire cypher from Cyptonomicon just for fun :D
